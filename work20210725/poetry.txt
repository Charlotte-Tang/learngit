I have had my invitation to this world's festival, and thus my life has been blessed. 
我接到这世界节日的请柬，我的生命受了祝福。

Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.
在清晓的密语中，我们约定了同去泛舟，世界上没有一个人知道我们这无目的无终止的遨游。

In the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone. In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise.
这时我自歌自笑。这时空气里也充满着应许的芬芳。

The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet.
我旅行的时间很长，旅途也是很长的。天刚破晓，我就驱车起行，穿遍广漠的世界，在许多星球之上，留下辙痕。
5.
Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows.Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service.Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might.Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles.And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.
请赐给我力量使我能轻闲地承受欢乐与忧伤。请赐给我力量使我的爱在服务中得到果实。请赐给我力量使我永不抛弃穷人也永不向淫威屈膝。请赐给我力量使我的心灵超越于日常琐事之上。再赐给我力量使我满怀爱意地把我的力量服从你意志的指挥。

If the day is done, if birds sing no more, if the wind has flagged tired, then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.From the traveller, whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended, whose garment is torn and dustladen, whose strength is exhausted, remove shame and poverty, and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night.
假如一天已经过去了，鸟儿也不歌唱，假如风也吹倦了，那就用黑暗的厚幕把我盖上罢，如同你在黄昏时节用睡眠的衾被裹上大地，又轻柔地将睡莲的花瓣合上。 旅客的行程未达，粮袋已空，衣裳破裂污损，而又筋疲力尽，你解除了他的羞涩
